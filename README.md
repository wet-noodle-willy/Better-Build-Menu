# Better Build Menu

Update the build menus because the default locations for some items is not intuitive (at least not for me).

Changes:

- Move Dig and Fill commands into separate Terraform submenu
- Add new keybind to open Structure submenu (default none)
- Move Barricade to Structure submenu
- Move torches, candelabrums into separate Lighting submenu
- Add Remove Wall Installation command to Lighting submenu
- Add Forbid Zone to Zones submenu
- Move Stable Floor and Haypile to Farming submenu
- Move Library Menu to be closer to Training Menu

If you have any questions or requests feel free to write them in the steam workshop comments.

**NOTE:**
This mod should work with other mods that add additional keepers as long as the mod creator does not modify the building groups of the base game.
