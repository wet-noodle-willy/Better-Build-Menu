# @Michal If you see this can you expand the `modify` keyword so it can also accept inheritance like this:
#   "class" modify inherit "subclass"   <- Overwrite contents of "class" with "subclass"
#   "class" modify inherit "subclass" append { more_data }
#
# or add a way to explicitly overwrite existing classes instead of throwing an error on name collision
#   "class" inherit "subclass"  <- Throws a duplicate keys error
#   "class" free  <- frees the class name so it can be used again
#   "class" inherit "subclass"  <- With "class" freed this would properly inherit "subclass" and no longer throw a duplicate keys error
# 
# Another nice to have would be the ability to prepend / add to the front of a list
#   "class" modify prepend { more_data } -> "class": { more_data, class_data }
#   "class" inherit "subclass" prepend { more_data }  -> "class": { more_data, subclass_data }
